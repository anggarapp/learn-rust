 I am the bone of my sword.
 Steel is my body, and fire is my blood.
 I have created over a thousand blades.
 Unaware of beginning,
 Nor aware of the end.
 Withstood pain with inconsistent weapons, my hands will never hold anything.
 Yet, my flame never ends.
 My whole body was still Unlimited Blade Works.
